# Testing Android In-App Purchases: Complete Guide

This guide covers testing Android in-app purchases using Google Play Console and various testing methods.

## Testing Methods Overview

There are several testing options for Android in-app purchases:

### 1. **Internal Testing** (Recommended for Development)
- Test with real Google Play infrastructure
- Use test accounts or your own account
- Fast deployment and testing
- Real transaction flow without charges

### 2. **License Testing** (Account-Based)
- Configure test accounts in Play Console
- Automatic test responses for purchases
- No real charges to test accounts
- Good for automated testing

### 3. **Internal App Sharing** (Quick Testing)
- Upload APK directly for immediate testing
- Bypass review process
- Good for rapid iteration
- Limited to testers you specify

### 4. **Play Billing Lab** (Advanced Testing)
- Test purchase flow in different regions
- Test with real payment methods (with permissions)
- Combine with license testing for comprehensive testing
- Download from Play Store for license testers

## Prerequisites

- **Google Play paid developer account** ($25 one-time fee)
- **App already released in Google Play Console** 
- **Billing permission** in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="com.android.vending.BILLING" />
  ```

## Product Configuration

1. **Navigate to Monetize ‚Üí Products**
2. **Create In-App Products**
   - Product ID (must match your code)
   - Title and description
   - Price in your default currency
   - Activate the product

## Internal Testing Method

### Step 1: Set Up Internal Testing Track

1. **Go to Release ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Internal testing**
2. **Create new release**
   - Upload your signed APK/AAB
   - Add release notes
   - Review and rollout

3. **Add Testers**
   - Add email addresses of testers
   - Or create email list in Play Console
   - Share the opt-in URL with testers

![Internal Testing Setup](./android-images/internal-testing-setup.png)

### Step 2: Install and Test

1. **Testers opt-in** using the provided URL
2. **Install app** from Play Store (may take a few minutes to appear)
3. **Test purchases** - they will be processed but not charged
4. **View test transactions** in Play Console

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Internal testing processes real transactions through Google Play Billing, but test accounts won't be charged. This gives you the most realistic testing experience.

## License Testing Method

### Step 1: Configure License Testers

1. **Go to Setup ‚Üí License testing** in Play Console
2. **Add Gmail accounts** under "License testers" section
   - Enter email addresses (one per line)
   - Must be valid Gmail accounts
   - Testers will receive email invitation

3. **Configure test responses:**
   - **PURCHASED** - Simulates successful purchase
   - **CANCELED** - Simulates user cancellation  
   - **UNAVAILABLE** - Simulates product unavailable
   - **ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED** - Simulates already purchased

**License Tester Benefits:**
- Can sideload debug builds without uploading to Play Store
- Bypass Google Play signature verification
- Test with various payment methods including test instruments
- No real charges for test purchases

### Step 2: Test with License Accounts

1. **Sign in** to test device with license testing account
2. **Install app** (can be debug build or sideloaded APK)
3. **Available test instruments:**
   - Test card (always approves)
   - Test card (always declines) 
   - Slow test card (approves after few minutes)
   - Slow test card (declines after few minutes)
4. **Test purchases** - responses will be simulated based on your configuration
5. **No real transactions** are processed

**Testing Benefits:**
- Works with debug builds and custom signatures
- No need to upload to Play Store for each test
- Test various payment scenarios with test instruments
- Ideal for automated testing flows

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: License testing uses simulated responses, so it's good for testing purchase flow but not for validating real Google Play integration.

## Play Billing Lab Testing

### Setup Play Billing Lab

1. **Download Play Billing Lab** from Play Store (license testers only)
2. **Sign in** with your license tester account
3. **Configure testing settings:**
   - Select test country/region
   - Enable real payment methods (requires permissions)
   - Apply configuration changes

### Regional Testing

1. **Select desired country** in Play Billing Lab
2. **Apply changes** and restart your app
3. **Test purchase flow** in selected region
4. **Verify pricing** and currency display

**Alternative without Play Billing Lab:**
- Create Gmail account in target country
- Use VPN to desired region
- Clear Play Store data/cache between tests

### Real Payment Method Testing

**Note:** Requires special permissions from Google Play Business Development.

1. **Enable real payment methods** in Play Billing Lab
2. **Test with actual payment instruments**
3. **Request refunds** for test purchases to avoid charges

## Testing Scenarios

### Basic Purchase Testing

1. **Load products** using your product IDs
2. **Initiate purchase** for each product type
3. **Handle purchase result**:
   - Success ‚Üí Acknowledge purchase
   - Pending ‚Üí Wait for completion
   - Error ‚Üí Handle gracefully

### Pending Transaction Testing

Test pending transactions using license testers with slow test cards:

1. **Test declining payment:**
   - Use "Slow test card, declines after a few minutes"
   - Purchase should show as `PENDING` initially
   - After few minutes, purchase fails
   - Verify app handles failure gracefully

2. **Test approving payment:**
   - Use "Slow test card, approves after a few minutes" 
   - Purchase shows as `PENDING` initially
   - After few minutes, purchase becomes `PURCHASED`
   - Verify app grants access when state changes

### Acknowledgment Testing

**CRITICAL**: All purchases must be acknowledged within 3 days or they will be automatically refunded.

```kotlin
// Example acknowledgment
if (purchase.purchaseState == Purchase.PurchaseState.PURCHASED) {
    if (!purchase.isAcknowledged) {
        val acknowledgePurchaseParams = AcknowledgePurchaseParams.newBuilder()
            .setPurchaseToken(purchase.purchaseToken)
            .build()
        billingClient.acknowledgePurchase(acknowledgePurchaseParams) { billingResult ->
            // Handle acknowledgment result
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Tools and Debugging

### 1. Google Play Console Testing Tools

- **Order management** - View all test transactions
- **Financial reports** - Analyze test transaction data



### 2. Android Debug Logging

Add comprehensive logging to track purchase flow:

```kotlin
Log.d("Billing", "üîç Querying products: $productList")
Log.d("Billing", "üì¶ Products found: ${productDetailsList.size}")
Log.d("Billing", "üí≥ Launching purchase for: ${productDetails.productId}")
Log.d("Billing", "‚úÖ Purchase successful: ${purchase.orderId}")
```

## Google Play Product Display Guidelines

### üìã Recommended Practices

While Google Play is less strict than Apple, following these practices improves user experience and compliance:

### Best Practices for Product Display

1. **Use Real Product Data**
   ```kotlin
   // Recommended: Use actual product details
   productDetails.name                    // Product name from Play Console
   productDetails.oneTimePurchaseOfferDetails?.formattedPrice  // Formatted price
   productDetails.description             // Product description
   ```

2. **Handle Localization**
   ```kotlin
   // Google Play handles currency conversion automatically
   val price = productDetails.oneTimePurchaseOfferDetails?.formattedPrice
   // Displays as "$9.99", "‚Ç¨8.99", "¬•1000", etc. based on user's region
   ```

3. **Dynamic Content Benefits**
   - **Automatic currency conversion** for international users
   - **Tax inclusion** where required by local law  
   - **Promotional pricing** updates automatically
   - **A/B testing** price changes through Play Console

### ‚ùå Not Recommended

```kotlin
// Avoid hardcoded values
Text("Premium Plan - $9.99")  // Static price
```

### ‚úÖ Recommended

```kotlin
// Use dynamic product data
Text("${productDetails.name} - ${productDetails.oneTimePurchaseOfferDetails?.formattedPrice}")
```

### Testing Product Display

- [ ] **Prices** show in correct local currency
- [ ] **Names** match Play Console configuration
- [ ] **Descriptions** display properly
- [ ] **Special offers** appear when configured

> üí° **Note**: Unlike iOS, Google Play won't reject apps for hardcoded prices, but using dynamic data provides better user experience and international support.

## Security and Validation

### 1. Server-Side Verification

Always verify purchases on your server:

```kotlin
// Send purchase token to your server for verification
val purchaseData = JsonObject().apply {
    addProperty("purchaseToken", purchase.purchaseToken)
    addProperty("productId", purchase.products[0])
    addProperty("orderId", purchase.orderId)
}
// POST to your verification endpoint
```

### 2. Local Verification

Verify purchase signature locally:

```kotlin
fun verifyPurchase(purchase: Purchase): Boolean {
    return Security.verifyPurchase(
        base64PublicKey, 
        purchase.originalJson, 
        purchase.signature
    )
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Development
- Use **Internal Testing** for most development work
- Test with multiple Google accounts
- Verify purchase acknowledgment timing
- Test offline/online scenarios

### For Pre-Release
